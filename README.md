PaCOS
=====

Simple operating system designed for the DCPU-16. Will update with more specific details when the project is further along - currently, things are changing too often to say.


Side Note:
There is a program called DATreconstruct used in the make file which can be found here:
https://github.com/melari/DATreconstruct
This is not actually needed for the assembly of the OS, but is useful for running the code in
emulators that double as assemblers (ie 0x10co.de and dcpu.ru)
